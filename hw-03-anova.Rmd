## Question 1
$H0:u_1=u_2=u_3=u_4=u_5\ vs\ Ha:atleast\ one\ u_i\ is\ not\ equal\ to\ another$ 

## Question 2
To evaluate these hypothesis, the p-value is calculated using an F distribution with K-1 and n-K degrees of freedom. Therefore: $(5 -1) = 4$, and $(45 - 5) = 40$ $degrees of freedom$.

## Question 3
Since the p-value of 0.0168 in consideration is less than our significance level of $a = 0.05$, we can say that the data provides sufficient evidence that at least one of the teaching methods has/have a mean test score that is different from the other teaching methods. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis.

## Question 4
